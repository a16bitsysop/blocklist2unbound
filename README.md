# blocklist2unbound
Convert host file blocklists to unbound blocklists

Based on: 
https://github.com/Aracktus/DNS-Unbound-Blocklist-Downloader

Updated to python 3 and changed blocklist to Steve Black at: 
https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts

If server supports it will check if blocklist needs updating first.
